# EstsharaBot

EstsharaBot is a medical application that revolutionizes the way we diagnose and detect cancer. By harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) and image classification, EstsharaBot provides accurate and efficient cancer diagnosis while incorporating a chatbot feature for accessible communication and personalized feedback. This mobile application is designed to simplify the process of obtaining a comprehensive report about a patient's medical condition based on their description.

## Objective

The main objectives of EstsharaBot are:

1. **Summarize Patient's Condition**: Assist doctors in summarizing a patient's condition using the comprehensive report generated by the application.

2. **Mobile Application with Chatbot**: Create a user-friendly mobile application that allows patients to obtain a report about their medical condition based on their description. The chatbot feature enables easy and accessible communication.

3. **Doctor Review Option**: Provide an option for users to allow their reports to be reviewed by doctors associated with the application, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the diagnosis.

4. **Cancer Classification**: Utilize advanced image classification models, including VGG16, MobileNet v3, DenseNet, Transformers, and Diet Classifier, to classify and predict types of cancers based on medical images.

## Used Models

EstsharaBot incorporates the following models for cancer diagnosis and image classification:

- VGG16
- MobileNet v3
- DenseNet

For Chatbot models we used:

- Transformers
- Diet Classifier

These models have been trained using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to accurately detect and classify different types of cancers.
